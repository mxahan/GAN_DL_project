## Code description
### CatGAN
The CatGAN files are 
- CatGan-Monkey_256.ipynb - For running the dataset in 256x256 resolution
- CatGan-Monkey_64.ipynb - For running the dataset in 64x64 resolution
-  Kaggle_Monkey_dataset_processing.ipynb - Data processing

Others are developed by different developer. 

### SGAN
The Semi-supervised codes are inside the working_codes directory in this repository. [link](https://github.com/mxahan/GAN_DL_project/tree/master/Working_codes)

The detail instructions are there for running SGAN codes.
