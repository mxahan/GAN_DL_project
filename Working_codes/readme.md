Well there are lots of code here.

I will go over the codes that needs to run the Semi-supervised learning code


The most important code is the sgan_train.py. 

Requirement: 
- Tensorflow 2.0 or higher
- Python 3.7, CV2
- Trained weights of inception v3 downloaded from keras application. Please Check the Transfer learning portion for the name.
- The monkey 10 data-set from kaggle. 

Please fix the location of the dataset in the code which is the work_path in the original code. 

After fixing them, run the "sga_train.py" in any suitable IDE. 

If having issues, Please let me know via [email](zhasan3@umbc.edu0
